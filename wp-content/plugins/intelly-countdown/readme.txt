**The Cialdini's principle**

As Robert Cialdini says, scarcity is one of the persuasion principles that people need to decide to buy.

Scarcity, today, is a Marketer’s need and could not be ignored to reach more sales.

= THE REAL PROBLEM =

Unfortunately, scarcity can be used ONLY in a one-time launch or offer, something that is not manageable for an evergreen product launch or a product that you want to be available 356 days/year.

EverGreen Countdown plugin solves this problem with a set-and-forget solution that give you the ability to use scarcity every time, personalizing the countdown timer for every single user visits your pages.
